CS61BL_Grading
==============

Here are the various python shell scripts that I wrote to facilitate and automate the grading of CS61BL assignments (summer of 2013). I had created a previous repo under the same name to store most of these same files but deleted it a later when I realized I had accidentally pushed solutions to some of the homework.

"get-work using subprocess.py" is a mostly functional copy of get-work except using the newer python module to do the same work.
